# Scaffolding done right
No learning curve - replace Ruby on Rails scaffold, no DSLs or 3rd party gems.

* Support namespaces for the model and the controllers
* You can generate scaffolds for nested resources
* Can override every file per project
* Supports different css frameworks - zurb / materializecss
* Generate fabricators
* Define #index, #edit/new and search during the scafold creation
* You can specify includes/joins for the #index action
* Implement basic search

# Install
The gem assume you have already in your Gemfile

    gem 'kaminari'
    gem 'slim-rails'
    gem 'simple_form'

    # And one of those
    #
    # gem 'materialize-sass'
    # gem 'foundation-rails'

There is no need to have it in your gem file.

    gem install scaffold_pico

# Overriding
If you want to change something you can override/change

    RAILS_ROOT/config/locales/en.scaffold_pico.yml
    RAILS_ROOT/lib/templates/pico/
                                /controller.rb
                                /search.rb
                                /fabricators
                                  fabrication.rb.erb
                                /views/{materialize|zurb} <<< Note !
                                  /materialize
                                    _form.html.slim.erb
                                    edit.html.slim.erb
                                    index.html.slim.erb
                                    new.html.slim.erb
                                    show.html.slim.erb
                                  /zurb
                                    _form.html.slim.erb
                                    edit.html.slim.erb
                                    index.html.slim.erb
                                    new.html.slim.erb
                                    show.html.slim.erb

# Develop

Clone the repo in ~/scaffold_pico or whatever, then in some rails project run the binary like this

    export SCAFFOLD_PICO_HOME=~/scaffold_pico
    ruby -I $SCAFFOLD_PICO_HOME/lib $SCAFFOLD_PICO_HOME/bin/scaffold_pico \
      --css_framework=materialize \
      --template=slim \
      -m User -n Admin -b AdminController \
      --fields name:string

# Known Issues
If you can't start scaffold_pico you might need to update your bundler

    gem update bundler

Help please: For some of the generated models/views there are extra blank links. It would be great if someone knows how to parse the erb and skip the new lines

You can't generate scaffolds for a mounted named engines. I don't know if we need this feature.
